# React + TypeScript + Vite

This was built upon the Vite template, which makes this app run smooth and fast!

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Spreading managed democracy across the galaxy

If you're a fan of the game Helldivers 2, test your knowledge and see if you're a true patriot of freedom and liberty, or if you're exhibiting sympathetic tendencies inclined to the Terminids and Automatons.

### Current Implementations

- This is a Single Page Application
- Uses libraries such as:
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Framer-Motion
  - (See dependencies in the [package.json file](https://github.com/WanderlustKing11/react-trivia/blob/main/package.json))
- No current sliders, just 'Next' and 'Prev' buttons that trigger animation to move forward or back on a selected trivia card.
- One custom button allows the user to reveal the card's answer.
- If you like, you can keep track of your score whenever your ideologies align with Super-Earth's with another custom Button Component that keeps track of the score count out of how many trivia questions you have answered. This means you are responsible for managing your own score, for now. But Super-Earth's Ministry of Truth will be updating a better tracking system in the future.
- One final Button Component to Restart the game.

#### Future Implementations
